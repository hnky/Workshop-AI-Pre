### Note:
 - A remote desktop in Azure will **not work** as you need to access the local network
 - If you have a Mac, a Virtual Machine with the above requirement can work.

Our kit runs on a Raspberry PI3 with Windows IoT core. [Check out what is in the kit](hardware.md).

## Option 2 - Bring your own (Advanced)
